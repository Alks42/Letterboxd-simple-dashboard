## Get Started
- You need to download your letterboxd data: Setting -> Import & Export -> Export Your Data. Or just click [here.](https://letterboxd.com/settings/data/)
- Drop .zip file in the project folder. You can delete simple_data.zip after that.
- Run dashboard.py

_(Optional, but highly recommended)_
- Register on tmdb website and [request api key.](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) Without api data you won't see countries and geners charts, total runtime and average rating acording to tmdb.
- The TMDB allows for 30-40 API requests every 10 seconds, so if you have hundreds of movies it could factor into the performance time.
